For this lab, I have written two bash scripts that automate running the two benchmarks.

test-iozone.sh
- The current file path shown in the command is my own; therefore, it must be changed to the user's own file path before running the script.
- This can be done by replacing '/home/alexis/Desktop/iozone3_490/src/current/iozone' with your own path
- The rest of the command arguments are correct.

test-fileio.sh
- These commands should work properly as is because the .c file exists within the same directory as the bash script
- Therefore, no changes are necessary.

You will also find a PDF labeled CS351-Lab3-Report, which contains data tables and summaries of my findings.
